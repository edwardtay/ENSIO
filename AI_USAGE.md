# AI Tool Usage

## Tools Used

- **Claude Code (Claude Opus 4.5)** — used for code generation, debugging, and implementation across the full stack

## Human Contributions

- Product concept and architecture: combining an AI chat agent with Uniswap v4 dynamic fee hooks, LiFi cross-chain routing, Circle CCTP bridging, and ENS payment resolution
- Smart contract design and deployment (PayAgentHook on Unichain Sepolia)
- Integration selection and system design decisions
- All prompting, code review, and direction of AI-generated output
- Testing and iteration on the live product

## AI-Assisted Sections

- Frontend React components (chat UI, route visualizer, message bubbles)
- API route handlers (chat, execute, agent endpoints)
- Library modules (routing logic, ENS resolution, Circle integration, x402 client)
- Configuration files (wagmi, tailwind, typescript)
- Solidity smart contract scaffolding
